this is my first webpage
- Project Name: Pride 2020
- Project Description: This project embodies the theme of Pride, a global movement that celebrates queerness and non-heternormativity and that promotes a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community to celebrate their gender identity and their sexuality. 

- what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create?
My motivation was to create a space that celebrates pride collectively but in the web since we have to stay at home and quearantined this year. That is why the style of the webpage is very texting messages (font) and bubbly like.

- Process: How did you go about implementing the concept?
Well, this is my first page so I did a lot of trial and error. I sketched the wireframe first, with the main ideas and content, although I was not very sure what was the best way of displaying content. I started with the home page, the header and the video. 

- Reflection/Evaluation:
In reflection, although not all my expectations were met, I am grateful to have learnt this much in a week. 'Pride 2020' shares a personal love story while it connects it to broader concepts and movements such as the history of pride (that is not as colorful as the pride flag) and its continuos struggles which I wish I could have added to the history of pride page, but I deliberately decided not to focus on the main pages. At the same time, it is very important to me to have the academia section because often, academia and the real worls struggles seem to not talk to each other. Academia is important to find the words that express LGBTQ+ experiences, as well as it is necessary to connect academia with real and daily life struggles. That is why, for instance, the Donate page exists. 

Due to my limited abilities and time constraint I changed some features from the pages. For instance, I would have liked to link better the webpages so people understand better the connections among donate and academia.  Also, I decided to display 2 out of the 4 selected countries whose LGBTQ+ communities are represented in the webpage, with the hope that I can research further and make it in the future. So, this is not the final version.
